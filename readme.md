# Programming Challenge

These programming challenges are used as a portion of the interview process.

**Note:** There are no trick questions, however there are some ways to go above and beyond the strict requirements of the question that can speak to the creativity of the candidate.

## How to Participate

Fork this repository and read the instruction text files in each challenge folder. Complete the challenges, commit and push back to your repository, then open a pull request against this project. We will close the pull request, but it notifies our dev team that someone has taken up the challenge!

## Rules

1. Submissions can be submitted in any language
2. Modify this readme to include a section
   on how we can run your code. This can either be an executable, docker image, a list of instructions, etc... We just need a way to be able to run your code on our computers!
3. 3rd-party vendor libraries can be used if needed

## Good luck!

Thank you!

## Execution Instructions

The solution to each challenge is written in JavaScript and located in the `index.js` file in each challenge folder. You can test them with Node.js (v12.14.1 is the current LTS version).

From the project root folder, you can run them all at once with ...

```sh
node main
```

or they can be exercised individually with ...

```sh
node "./Challenge 1 - Sorting/index.js"
node "./Challenge 2 - Palindrome/index.js"
node "./Challenge 3 - Anagram/index.js"
```
